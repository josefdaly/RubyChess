# RubyChess

Welcome to Ruby Chess. Ruby Chess is a simple command line chess game. The players may be either human or computer. So feel free to play a friend, a computer, or just watch two AI's play each other. Any and all suggestions are welcome. I would love for my AI to be smarter.

Ruby chess is available as a gem.

```
gem install ruby_chess
```
